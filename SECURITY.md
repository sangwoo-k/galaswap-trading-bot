# Security Guide for GalaSwap Trading Bot

## üîí Security Overview

This trading bot implements multiple layers of security to protect your funds and data. This guide outlines the security features and best practices for secure deployment and operation.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### 1. Data Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** for all sensitive data
- **Secure key management** with environment variables
- **Encrypted private key storage** with additional authentication data
- **Secure random number generation** for unique keys

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with configurable expiration
- **Request signing** for all API calls to GalaSwap
- **Unique key generation** to prevent replay attacks
- **Rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Strict input validation** for all user inputs
- **SQL injection prevention** through parameterized queries
- **XSS protection** with input sanitization
- **Wallet address validation** with format checking

### 4. Network Security
- **HTTPS/TLS encryption** for all communications
- **CORS configuration** to restrict cross-origin requests
- **Helmet.js** for security headers
- **Request rate limiting** per IP address

### 5. Monitoring & Logging
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for all operations
- **Security event monitoring** with real-time alerts
- **Failed authentication tracking** with automatic blocking
- **Suspicious activity detection** and alerting

## üîê Security Configuration

### Environment Variables Security

```bash
# Critical: Use strong, unique values
JWT_SECRET=your_very_strong_jwt_secret_key_here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key

# Wallet security
GALA_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x... # Your wallet address
GALA_PRIVATE_KEY=encrypted_private_key # Encrypted private key
GALA_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key # Your public key
```

### Key Generation Best Practices

1. **JWT Secret**: Use a cryptographically secure random string (64+ characters)
2. **Encryption Key**: Exactly 32 characters, mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
3. **Private Key**: Store encrypted, never in plain text

## üö® Security Monitoring

### Real-time Alerts
The bot monitors for:
- **Failed authentication attempts** (>5 in 1 hour = critical alert)
- **Unusual trading patterns** (>20 trades in 5 minutes = high alert)
- **High error rates** (>10% = warning)
- **Memory usage spikes** (>90% = warning)
- **Slow API responses** (>5 seconds = warning)

### Security Event Types
- `authentication`: Login attempts and failures
- `authorization`: Permission and access control events
- `api_call`: API request monitoring
- `trade_execution`: Trading activity tracking
- `error`: System errors and exceptions

## üîß Security Hardening

### Server Security
1. **Use a dedicated VPS** or secure cloud instance
2. **Enable firewall** and restrict ports
3. **Keep system updated** with latest security patches
4. **Use SSH key authentication** instead of passwords
5. **Disable root login** and use sudo for administrative tasks

### Application Security
1. **Run as non-root user** in production
2. **Use Docker** for containerized deployment
3. **Enable security headers** with Helmet.js
4. **Implement proper CORS** configuration
5. **Use environment variables** for all secrets

### Network Security
1. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
2. **Implement VPN** for remote access
3. **Use private networks** when possible
4. **Monitor network traffic** for anomalies
5. **Implement DDoS protection**

## üìä Security Monitoring Setup

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor security logs
tail -f logs/security.log

# Monitor error logs
tail -f logs/error.log

# Monitor all logs
tail -f logs/trading-bot.log
```

### Health Check Monitoring
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Get security metrics
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics
```

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Incident Checklist
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Stop the trading bot if compromised
   - Isolate the affected system
   - Preserve logs and evidence
   - Notify relevant stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Review security logs
   - Analyze attack vectors
   - Identify compromised data
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Rotate all secrets and keys
   - Update security configurations
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Implement additional security measures

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct security review
   - Update security procedures
   - Train team on lessons learned
   - Monitor for recurring issues

## üîç Security Testing

### Regular Security Checks
1. **Dependency scanning** for vulnerabilities
2. **Code security review** and static analysis
3. **Penetration testing** of the application
4. **Network security assessment**
5. **Access control testing**

### Automated Security Tools
```bash
# Install security scanning tools
npm install -g audit-ci
npm install -g snyk

# Run security audit
npm audit

# Run Snyk security scan
snyk test
```
